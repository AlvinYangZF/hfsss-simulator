# HFSSS Requirement Coverage Analysis

**Document Version**: V3.0
**Date**: 2026-04-19

---

## Overview

This document analyzes the coverage of the 178 requirements from the Requirements Matrix against the current HFSSS implementation. Requirements REQ-001 through REQ-138 cover core functionality; REQ-139 through REQ-178 cover enterprise SSD features added in PRD V2.0 (Chapter 12).

**V3.0 Update (2026-04-19)**: End-to-end code audit against current source tree. Phase 4 (boot/NOR/FTL reliability/trace) and most of Phase 5/6 (OOB/hfsss-ctrl/YAML/perf framework/fault-inject) plus the Enterprise V3.0 groups (UPLP, Multi-NS, Security, Thermal/Telemetry) are now landed. Coverage rises from 38.8% to **65.2%** fully implemented (86.5% counting partials). Post-review corrections: REQ-132 (NAND fault wiring pending), REQ-161 (TCG Opal command parsing pending), REQ-163 (sanitize action modes partial), REQ-164 (`secure_boot_verify` not invoked from boot flow), REQ-165 (key table persists to arbitrary file, not NOR), REQ-175/176 (telemetry ring exists but NVMe Log Page 07h/08h dispatch not wired) all demoted from ✅ to ⚠️.

**V2.0 Update**: Added 40 enterprise requirements (REQ-139 through REQ-178) covering UPLP, QoS Determinism, T10 DIF/PI, Security, Multi-Namespace Management, Thermal Management, and Advanced Telemetry.

**V1.2 Update**: Reflects Phase 1 (FTL/Media), Phase 2 (Controller/HAL), Phase 3 (User-space NVMe) completions.

### Status Definitions
- ✅ **Implemented**: Requirement is fully implemented with at least one passing test
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Requirement is partially implemented; feature set or test coverage not complete
- ❌ **Not Implemented**: Requirement is not implemented
- 🔧 **Stub**: Only placeholder/stub implementation exists

## Key Observations

### What's Working Well

Phases 0 through 6 are substantially landed, plus the Enterprise V3.0 UPLP / Multi-NS / Security / Thermal-Telemetry groups. Module-level state:

- **HAL Layer**: 75% (NAND + NOR drivers, completion submission, namespace mgmt, power states; AER is stub pending LLD_13)
- **Media Layer**: 75% (NAND hierarchy + timing + reliability + BBT + full NOR with 7-partition layout and mmap persistence)
- **Controller Thread**: 80% (timeout mgmt, backpressure, QoS buckets, GC traffic control, DWRR + latency monitor)
- **FTL Layer**: 81.8% (Cost-Benefit GC + wear leveling + WAF + command state machine + read/write retry with voltage offsets + multi-level flow control + T10 PI CRC-16)
- **PCIe/NVMe User-Space**: 54.5% (admin / IO / DSM / identify / doorbell / CQ; kernel-side DMA/MSI-X/IOMMU remain Phase 7)
- **Common Services**: 75% (mutex/semaphore/msgqueue/mempool, boot 6-stage + dual-slot firmware, power mgmt, OOB JSON-RPC, SMART, trace ring, watchdog, UPLP, thermal, telemetry, secure boot, security key table)
- **Product Interfaces**: 50% — `/proc`, `hfsss-ctrl`, YAML config landed; block-device REQ-124 remains Phase 7
- **Fault Injection**: 66.7% (NAND registry + power-fail hooks; controller-wide hooks partial)
- **Enterprise UPLP / Multi-NS / Security / Thermal-Telemetry**: 100% / 100% / 85.7% / 75%

Clean ASAN and TSAN runs on the default + sanitizer builds; `make test` reports 0 failures across ~2,759 assertions as of PR #86.

### Architecture Decision: User-Space vs. Kernel Module

The PRD and HLD/LLD documents describe a Linux **kernel module** (`hfsss_nvme.ko`) as the host interface. The current implementation stays in user-space and reaches the guest via a **QEMU-NVMe → NBD → `hfsss-nbd-server`** bridge:

- Phases 0–6 build the core SSD simulation + sanity/perf/reliability harnesses in user-space (complete)
- Phase 7 (optional) adds the kernel module for real `/dev/nvme` block device support — currently deferred
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/QEMU_BLACKBOX_TESTING.md`

### Remaining Major Gaps

1. **Phase 7 kernel module** (REQ-006/009/013/014/019/020/021/022/023/124/064) — intentional deferral; user-space simulator cannot provide kernel-side DMA, MSI-X, IOMMU, or `/dev/nvmeXnY` directly.
2. **Performance target enforcement** (REQ-116..123) — benchmark framework exists in `src/perf/perf_validation.c`, but IOPS/BW/latency pass/fail thresholds and the final `perf_validation_run_all` report are not asserted.
3. **Full AER delivery + PCIe link-state machine** (REQ-063 stub, REQ-064) — the async-event queue + L0/L0s/L1/L2/RESET/FLR machine from LLD_13 remain pending.
4. **Deep QoS features beyond DWRR** (REQ-148..151, 153) — per-NS IOPS/BW caps, strict P99 SLA rollback, and hot-reconfiguration are partial against the LLD_18 target.
5. **RAID-like data protection** (REQ-114) — die-level XOR parity and dual-copy L2P not implemented; BBT dual mirror exists via NOR partitions.
6. **IPC ring + resource sampling** (REQ-085, 087) — SPSC ring and periodic CPU/memory/thread-pool sampling not implemented; watchdog covers hang detection only.
7. **Striping / memory partitioning** (REQ-099, 076) — single-channel mapping and unpartitioned mmap/malloc remain as designed for the current build.
8. **T10 PI through the GC rewrite path** (REQ-157) and **Error Log Page population** (REQ-115, 158) — computed and verified end-to-end on the read path; full propagation / reporting pending.
9. **Secure physical erase** (REQ-163) — distinct from the already-implemented crypto erase (REQ-162); a block-by-block sanitize pass is not wired.
10. **RT scheduling** (REQ-075) — `SCHED_FIFO`/`SCHED_RR` hook absent; `pthread_setaffinity_np` side (REQ-074) is wired under Linux.
11. **Long-haul stability report** (REQ-137) — `tests/stress_stability.c` provides the harness, but no published multi-day run.

## Next Steps

Current position: **core + enterprise features largely landed; polish and gap-closure in progress.**

Near-term priorities:
1. Close **REQ-063 AER** and **REQ-064 PCIe link-state** per LLD_13, then flip HAL from 75% to ~92%.
2. Enforce **perf targets** (REQ-116..120) in `perf_validation_run_all`, converting the 5 ⚠️ rows to ✅.
3. Wire **Error Log Page** (REQ-115, 158) and **GC-path PI propagation** (REQ-157) — closes most of Section 6 + T10 PI group.
4. Add physical **secure erase** (REQ-163) on top of the existing crypto erase.

Mid-term:
5. Broaden QoS coverage — per-NS IOPS/BW limits (REQ-148/149), P99 SLA enforcement (REQ-150), hot-reconfigure (REQ-151).
6. Implement SPSC IPC ring + periodic resource sampling (REQ-085, 087).
7. Schedule a published multi-day soak run (REQ-137) off the existing `stress_stability` harness.

Long-term:
8. **Phase 7 kernel module** — optional path to real `/dev/nvme`; gated on Phases 0–6 stability (now satisfied).

See `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for the phase-indexed plan.
